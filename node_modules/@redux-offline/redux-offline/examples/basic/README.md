Visualization of Redux Offline's request resolution.

## Installation

Install and start the server:

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

Then, start the client:

```bash
cd client
yarn && yarn start
```

This launches a Webpack dev server, which hosts the static content. Other requests are proxied to the server launched previously.
